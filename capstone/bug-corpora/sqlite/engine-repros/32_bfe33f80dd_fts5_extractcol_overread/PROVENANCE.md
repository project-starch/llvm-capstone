# bfe33f80dd_0 -- bfe33f80dd

Upstream fix `bfe33f80dd`. Collected in round R3 (backport filter).

The reduction is argued in the case source's own header, reproduced here so the
claim travels with the case rather than living only in the build tree.

```
bfe33f80dd_0 -- upstream corrupt-database regression image, backported to 3.22.0.
 *
 * Collected by the backport filter: upstream fix bfe33f80dd removes code that is still
 * present in 3.22.0 (or guards a function 3.22.0 has unguarded), and its own regression
 * test ships the triggering database as a hex dump. Host ASan on stock 3.22.0:
 *
 *     heap-buffer-overflow in fts5IndexExtractCol
 *
 * The image is embedded and served by repro322_memfs.c, an in-domain in-memory FILESYSTEM.
 * ext/misc/memvfs.c cannot be used here: it serves only the main database, so the pager
 * cannot create a rollback journal, and it takes its buffer as an INTEGER in the URI --
 * a pointer forged from an integer, which on a capability machine is untagged and faults
 * on first use.
 *
 * STATEMENT BY STATEMENT, deliberately. Handing the whole script to one sqlite3_exec()
 * stops at the first error, and these scripts routinely take SQLITE_CORRUPT on an early
 * statement while the defect is reached by a later one. Screening the whole script in one
 * call scored 3 of 17; per statement it scores 10 of 17, matching a real file exactly.
 *
 * REACHABILITY: every statement's rc is printed. SQLITE_CORRUPT (11) on the statement that
 * should reach the defect means SQLite rejected the image first -- a real negative, not a
 * silent pass.
```
