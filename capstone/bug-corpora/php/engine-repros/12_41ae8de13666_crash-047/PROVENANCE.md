# CRASH-047: provenance

**Corpus.** `php-5.0.0-bug-corpus` (zip sha256 `31d22a3b468e96e0ff9f991d8667e78a7d5311db8767d7067bf8c76cbdf92064`), the collaborator's corpus of
185 PHP 5.0.0 defects, each a distinct root cause audited against the 5.0.0 source. Its record
for this case, verbatim:

**Trigger.** `trigger.php` is `corpus/CRASH-047.php` from that zip, byte for byte (sha256
`94aebffa37f61d5f2b60a59171bfcde4416e645b01789140fab44420c2287c31`).

**Oracle, ours.** Measured on p12, gcc 15.2.0, libasan from gcc 15, 2026-10-27 with the corpus's own `scripts/run-corpus.py`
against three builds of the pinned museum tarball (sha256
`5783e0c0ba94f165633a565fe73a83e59cf17b6880ef95fa8f936dc6301d6919`) made by the corpus's
recipes: `asan` (its two `zend_alloc.c` detector patches, `-fsanitize=address`),
`stockalloc` (the same without those two patches: PHP's allocator as shipped under ASan), and
the plain build. `oracle.json` carries the result: ASan `ASAN:heap-use-after-free` at `Zend/zend_execute_API.c:389` in
`_zval_ptr_dtor`, stockalloc `OK`, pristine `OK` (rc 0).
Hence **asan-blind**: ASan reports it only with PHP's allocator patched (cache off, no 8-byte rounding); with zend_alloc.c as shipped the run reads OK, so emalloc's cache or rounding hides it from any detector at free().

**Where our run and the corpus's record disagree:** nowhere -- ASan class, pristine outcome and the crash flag all agree.

**Upstream fix.** php-src `41ae8de13666`, the directory prefix `41ae8de13666`.
